# Pet-Adoption-Webpage

Hey, this is my 1st responsive web page known as 'Pet Adoption'.

I developed this webpage using Technologies: HTML & CSS.

This web page shows information on 'pets' for adoption, in the form of Cards with the help of Flexbox.

I learned about media_queries and the most common media_features: width, min_width, and max_width, and implemented them to develop this responsive web page, on which responsive changes happen when the width of viewport is less than or equal to the specified width.
